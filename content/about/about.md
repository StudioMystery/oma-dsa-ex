We are a political and activist organization, not a party; through campus and community-based chapters, DSA members use a variety of tactics, from legislative to direct action, to fight for reforms that empower working people.

## Who We Are

The Democratic Socialists of America is the largest socialist organization in the United States, with over 92,000 members and chapters in all 50 states.

We believe that working people should run both the economy and society democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few.

## What We Do

We are a political and activist organization, not a party; through campus and community-based chapters, DSA members use a variety of tactics, from legislative to direct action, to fight for reforms that empower working people.

## Other Nebraska Chapters

There is currently one other DSA chapter in Nebraska: The [Lincoln DSA](https://dsanebraska.org/).

At-large members across the state actively organize and strategize with the Lincoln chapter.

You can use the national DSA’s [chapter lookup tool](https://chapters.dsausa.org/) to find your local chapter by zip code, or to learn more about organizing a chapter in other parts of the state.
